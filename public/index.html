        <h4>I was always fascinated with design.</h4>

          Conceptually, its a problem you cannot solve, but that doesn't stop
          people from trying. Say what you will about supposedly more complex
          back end systems design... most of those problems come pre-solved,
          quite often some of the most interesting problems of computer science
          were were first tackled before there were computers to science. But no
          one has solved art yet.

          I have only gotten my feet wet in design so far, editing a year book
          here, a school paper there, but god knows I had no idea what I was
          doing for any of it. I find the entire process fascinating and well
          beyond my scope which only makes it more fascinating. I don't ever see
          myself as specializing in this kind of design work but I cannot stand
          a mystery... and so hope help me when I sit down on a blank canvas all
          I see is mystery. All I want is to push my bar of understanding a
          little further than it is now, that doesn't seem like much to ask.
